Today we had to make a 3D letter using the Python with Turtle language. The turtle.begin_fill command made the turtle fill in the shape it had just created. The def draw_T created a function with which we could use the code "draw_T()" to draw the 3D T. To get all the right lengths of lines I used a very mathematical technique called “Trial and Error”.
