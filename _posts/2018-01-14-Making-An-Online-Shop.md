**8.1.18**

First I made a list of all of the items I intended to sell and their prices. Further to the right of the list, I made a place where you could type in the item you were selling, like "Minced Beef", and it came up with the price, £3. 

Below that I made a place that added up the total price, so I didn't have to do it myself, and if needed, also gave the price a discount, so once again, I didn’t have to do it myself.
